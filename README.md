Hello, My name is Tom and I'm gonna be an Electrical Engineer! I love hunting, fishing, and gaming. When I can't be doing those things, I'm usually working.

I'm interested in hardware design, pcb design, and control systems. I would very much like to work in the Aerospace field and design avionics.

I'm currently taking mobile robot planning and ROS classes, as well as control systems, microfabrication, and power electronics courses. I've taken continuous and discrete 
systems and signals, microelectronics, antennas, circuit analysis, power systems, spacecraft systems engineering, electromagnetics, digital design, mechanics, statics, 
dynamics, and thermodynamics courses.

I'm currently working on my senior design project, where my group and I are building a "walkie-textie"

You can reach me at tom.nilsen13@gmail.com and at thomas.nilsen@ifit.com
